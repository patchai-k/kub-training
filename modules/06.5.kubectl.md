# kubectl

## Module Objectives

*  Pratice using kubectl commands

----

## **IMPORTANT SETUP**
Run the following to setup your environment while in your *workspace* directory:

```shell
~/kubernetes-training/starting-points/start.sh kubectl
```

1. Display the logs of a pod

    Look at the logs of the `frontend` pod:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs db
    ```

1. Edit a pod

    ```shell
    kubectl edit pod frontend
    ```

    Search for the `image` line and add an "X" at the end of
    the line to give the
    image an incorrect pathname that will result in an error.  Save the
    file.  Verify the pod fails to start and gets an `ErrImagePull` error:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod frontend
    ```

    Do another `kubectl edit pod frontend` and remove the "X" on the
    `image` line, save the file and verify the pod is `Running` again
    without an `ErrImagePull` error.

1. Save yaml to a file

    Choose a running pod and save its output in yaml:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod frontend -o yaml > frontend_out.yaml
    ```

    Inspect the yaml.

1. Configure for kubectl auto-completion

    ```shell
    echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
    . ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Then run commands and press *<esc>* for auto completion.
    For example, if you have a `frontend` pod running, type:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod fr<esc>
    ```
    where *\<esc\>* is the escape character.

## **IMPORTANT CLEANUP**
