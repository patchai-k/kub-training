## Use Node Selection with a pod.

- Get the list of nodes in your kubernetes cluster:

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

  Show the nodes with the labels:

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes --show-labels
    ```

    Describe the node to see the labels:

    ```shell
    kubectl describe <SELECT-A-NODE FROM-ABOVE> | less
    ```

    Add a custom label to just one node:

    ```shell
    kubectl label nodes gpu=amd
    ```

    See the label on the node:

    ```shell
    kubectl describe node <SELECT-A_NODE-FROM-ABOVE> | less
    ```

    Change a pod spec to include:

    ```yaml
         nodeSelector:
            gpu: amd
    ```

    Then look at the results:

    ```shell
        kubectl get pods -o wide
    ```

    Remove the label.
