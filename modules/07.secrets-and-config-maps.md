## **IMPORTANT SETUP**
Run the following to setup your environment

```shell
~/kubernetes-training/starting-points/start.sh configuration
```

## Use Secrets and ConfigMaps to Externalize Application Credentials and Configuration

One major problem with our current deployment is that we hardcoded the MySQL root password in the Pod configuration file. In most cases, we need to externalize secrets and configuration from the Kubernetes object definition. We can use Secrets and ConfigMaps to do that.

1. Create a Secret with the MySQL administrator password.

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic mysql --from-literal=password=root
    ```

1. Expose the `mysql` Secret as an environment variable in the `db` Pod. Modify the `env` section in the `db.yaml` to look like the following.

    ```yaml
    env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mysql
          key: password
    ```

    Here we are telling Kubernetes to get the value for the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` variable from the `mysql` Secret. Each Secret can have multiple key-value pairs, in our case we get the value from the `password` key.

1. Add exactly the same `env` section to the `backend.yaml`.

1. Modify the startup command in the `backend.yaml` file.

    ```yaml
    command: ["sh", "-c", "app -mode=backend -run-migrations -port=8080 -db-host=db -db-password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ]
    ```

    As you can see, here we call `sh` instead of calling our app directly. The shell is required to do environment variable substitution for us. Also we use `$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` instead of a hardcoded password.

1. Redeploy `backend` and `db`. The database Pod should be redeployed before `db`, because the backend attempts to create a required empty database only on startup,
but if the *db* pod isn't running, then the required database will not be created.

    > Note: You will not be able to use `kubectl apply` command this time. Instead, you should use `kubectl delete` first and then redeploy pod.

1. Refresh the frontend and make sure that the app is still working fine.

## Optional Exercises

### ConfigMaps

1. Create a config map with a key that contains port for the backend. Use the value from the config map in the backend startup command.

## **IMPORTANT CLEANUP**
Run the following to cleanup your environment

```shell
~/kubernetes-training/starting-points/cleanup.sh configuration
```
