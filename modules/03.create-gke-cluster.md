DEPLOY KUBERNETES
=================

Module objectives
-----------------


- Enable GCP cloud services
- Create Kubernetes cluster
- Review created infrastructure

---

In this module, you will use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) managed service to deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

---

Theory
------

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) does containerized application management at scale. One may deploy a wide variety of applications to Kubernetes cluster and operate this cluster seamlessly with high availability.

One may scale both cluster and applications to meet increased demand and move applications freely between on-premise and cloud.

Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of nodes. Master nodes coordinate container placement and store cluster state. Worker nodes actually run the application containers.

---

1. Ensure all APIs we may use are enabled and make sure you are running in the Google Cloud Shell.
    ```shell
    gcloud services enable \
      container.googleapis.com \
      compute.googleapis.com \
      containerregistry.googleapis.com \
      cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
      sourcerepo.googleapis.com \
      monitoring.googleapis.com \
      logging.googleapis.com \
      stackdriver.googleapis.com
    ```
    <!-- TODO: explain what each API does -->
1. Create a Kubernetes cluster.

    ```shell
    gcloud beta container clusters create k8s-training \
    --num-nodes 2 \
    --machine-type n1-standard-2 \
    --labels=project=k8s-training \
    --image-type COS \
    --preemptible \
    --enable-stackdriver-kubernetes \
    --enable-autorepair \
    --no-enable-basic-auth \
    --no-issue-client-certificate \
    --enable-ip-alias \
    --metadata disable-legacy-endpoints=true \
    --enable-network-policy \
    --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting,cloud-platform,compute-rw,storage-rw,service-control,service-management"
    ```
    <!-- TODO: explain what each flag does -->

    Output:
    ```shell
    WARNING: ....
    Creating cluster k8s-training in us-west1-c...

    kubeconfig entry generated for k8s-training.
    NAME          LOCATION    MASTER_VERSION    MASTER_IP       MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION   NUM_NODES  STATUS
    k8s-training  us-west1-c  1.13.11-gke.14    35.235.101.300  n1-standard-2  1.13.11-gke.14 2          RUNNING
    ```

1. If accessing from outside of the Cloud Shell, for example, your desktop or laptop:  Get credentials for the cluster

    ```shell
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials k8s-training
    ```
    Output:
    ```shell
    Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
    kubeconfig entry generated for k8s-training.
    ```

1. Verify that you can connect to the cluster and list the nodes.

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
    This command should display all cluster nodes. In the GCP console open
    'Compute Engine' -> 'VM instances' to verify that each node has a
    corresponding VM with the same name.

1. Grant cluster admin permissions to the current user:

    ```shell
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
      --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
      --user="$(gcloud config list account --format 'value(core.account)')"
    ```

    > Note: You need these permissions to create the necessary role
    based access control (RBAC) rules for Helm and other cluster
    level permissions.

Module summary
--------------
You enabled GCP services needed for creating a Kubernetes cluster, created a cluster,
verified the cluster nodes by communicating with the cluster via
``kubectl get nodes`` and then granted yourself additional
permissions for the Kubernetes cluster.
