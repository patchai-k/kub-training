# Installing a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Kubernetes Operations (kops)

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes CLI [kubctl documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* Google Cloud SDK [gcloud tools documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/)
* Kubernetes Operations [kops documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/install.md)

>Note: We will use the Google Cloud Shell which already has kubectl and gcloud tools installed

### Exercise 1: Deploy kubernetes to GCP

1. Open the GCP console from your browser. [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

1. Login and select the assigned project or create a new one from the top menu

1. Enable (if not already) the Compute Engine API here [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/compute.googleapis.com/)

1. Enable (if not already) the Google Cloud Storage JSON API here [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/storage-api.googleapis.com/)

1. Launch the Google Cloud Shell from the top right menu

    >Note: All following commands will be run in this shell

1. Run the following commands to set the proper region and zone:

    ```console
    gcloud config set compute/region us-west1

    gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-c
    ```

    Check that gcloud config has been updated with values set above in section `[compute]`
    ```console
    gcloud config list   
    ```

1. Install kops

   Run the following commands to download and install kops:

   ```console
   curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64

   chmod +x kops-linux-amd64

   mkdir -p $HOME/bin && cp kops-linux-amd64 "$_/kops"

   PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

   echo 'PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

1. Create a state store

    Run the following command to create a bucket. Come up with a unique name and replace `<unique name>`. Please refer to the [GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming) for appropriate bucket names.

    ```console
    BUCKET="kubernetes-<unique name>"
    ```

    ```console
    gsutil mb gs://${BUCKET}
    ```
    Here we are creating a GCP bucket to store the cluster configuration for kops

1. Create the cluster configuration

   Run the following commands

   ```console
   PROJECT=`gcloud config get-value project`

   export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=AlphaAllowGCE # to unlock the GCE features

   kops create cluster simple.k8s.local --zones us-west1-c --state gs://${BUCKET} --project=${PROJECT}
   ```

   >Note: This only created the configuration which can be viewed here:

   ```console
   kops get cluster --state gs://${BUCKET}

   kops get instancegroup --state gs://${BUCKET} --name simple.k8s.local

   kops get cluster --state gs://${BUCKET} simple.k8s.local -oyaml
   ```
   >Note: We can set a variable for the state store to make commands shorter:

   ```console
   export KOPS_STATE_STORE=gs://${BUCKET}

   echo "export BUCKET=${BUCKET}" >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export KOPS_STATE_STORE=gs://${BUCKET}' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=AlphaAllowGCE' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

1. Building the cluster in GCE

   Run the following command and confirm the output

   ```console
   kops update cluster simple.k8s.local
   ```

   To proceed with the operation we need to confirm the command by running

   ```console
   kops update cluster simple.k8s.local --yes
   ```

   Validate
   ```console
   watch kops validate cluster
   ```

   While the cluster is being created, the above command will display
   various errors and this is normal.  Example errors you may see while
   the cluster is being created:

   ```console
   unexpected error during validation: error listing nodes: Get https://34.82.80.99
    /api/v1/nodes: dial tcp 34.82.80.99:443: i/o timeout
    unexpected error during validation: error listing nodes: Get https://34.82.80.99
    /api/v1/nodes: net/http: TLS handshake timeout
    Validation Failed
    ```

   After a few minutes the cluster will be ready and will report:

   ```console
   Your cluster simple.k8s.local is ready
    ```
   
   Your cluster can then be viewed using `kubectl`

   ```console
   kubectl cluster-info

   kubectl get nodes --show-labels
   ```

   ssh into the master

   ```console
   gcloud compute ssh $(gcloud compute instances list|awk '/master/ {print $1}')  
   ```

### Exercise 2 (Optional): Identify resources that have been created

1. In GCE Cloud Console find and investigate the following resources, that have been created as a result of previous exercises

    * Compute Engine -> VM instances
    * Compute Engine -> Disks
    * Compute Engine -> Instance groups
    * Compute Engine -> Instance templates
    * VPC Network -> External IP addresses
    * VPC Network -> Firewall rules
    * Network services -> Load balancing
