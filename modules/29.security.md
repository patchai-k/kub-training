# Security

## Module Objectives

* Install and run `kube-bench` on a cluster

`kube-bench` runs checks against a Kubernetes cluster to see if the
cluster is deployed securely as documented in the *CIS Kubernetes Benchmark*.

`kube-bench` reports PASS, FAIL or WARN for each item it checks,
followed by remediations and a summary.

## Configure for docker

`ssh` to the master and worker nodes in the cluster and configure
your login user to be in the `docker` group so you can run `docker`
without being super-user:

1. ssh to the master node and each worker node and type:
```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
2. `exit` the shell (it won't take effect until the next login).

## Determine the major and minor server version of the Kubernetes server
1. Run:
    ```shell
    kubectl version --short | grep Server
    ```
    The output will be similar to:
    ```
    Server Version: v1.13.11-gke.14
    ```

The above shows the server major and minor version is `1.13` so
you would use `--version 1.13` in the below `kube-bench` commands.

## Run kube-bench on the *master*

1. `ssh` to the *master* node
2. Run `kube-bench` via a container on the *master*.
Note: Specify the Kubernetes server version you are running for the
`--version X.Y` option.
```shell
docker run --pid=host -t aquasec/kube-bench:latest master --version 1.13
```

## Run kube-bench on a worker node

1. `ssh` to a *worker* node
2. Run `kube-bench` via a container on the worker node.
Note: Specify the Kubernetes server version you are running for the
`--version X.Y` option.
```shell
docker run --pid=host -t aquasec/kube-bench:latest node --version 1.13
```
