# Welcome to Altoros Training

The Kubernetes labs are designed to tell a story as the labs progress, however the labs are idempotent. This means that each lab starts at an exact starting place and things are cleaned up at the end of each lab. Each lab will use familiar components to provide a sense of continuity.

## Scripts

### `start.sh`

This script is passed a lab name and performs the following:

1. Copy over the `workspace` directory for the lab
1. Create needed objects in Kubernetes

### `cleanup.sh`

This script is passed a lab name and performs the following:

1. Backup current `workspace` directory into `~/kubernetes-training/workspace_backup/<lab name>`
1. Clean the `workspace` directory
1. Dump a backup of Kubernetes Objects to `~/kubernetes-training/workspace_backup/<lab name>/_k8s_object_backup.yaml`
1. Delete all kubernetes objects
