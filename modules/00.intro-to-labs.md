# Welcome to Altoros Training

The Kubernetes labs are designed to tell a story as the labs progress, however the labs are idempotent. This means that each lab starts at a known starting place and things are cleaned up at the end of each lab. Each lab will use familiar components to provide a sense of continuity.

## Scripts

### `start.sh`

This script is passed a lab name and performs the following:

1. Copy over the `workspace` directory for the lab
1. Create needed objects in Kubernetes

### `cleanup.sh`

This script is passed a lab name and performs the following:

1. Backup current `workspace` directory into `~/kubernetes-training/workspace_backup/<lab name>`
1. Clean the `workspace` directory
1. Dump a backup of Kubernetes Objects to `~/kubernetes-training/workspace_backup/<lab name>/_k8s_object_backup.yaml`
1. Delete all kubernetes objects
