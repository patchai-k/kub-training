# Ingress

## Module Objectives

1. Serve app traffic from the Ingress instead of LoadBalancer service
1. Use static IP with Ingress
1. Specify app domain
1. Add SSL support
---

## **IMPORTANT SETUP**
Run the following to setup your environment

```shell
~/kubernetes-training/starting-points/start.sh ingress
```

---


## Theory

Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.

Ingress can provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

---

## Use Ingress

1. Change the `frontend` Service type from `LoadBalancer` to `NodePort`.

    ```shell
    kubectl edit svc/frontend
    ```

    * Find the line `type: LoadBalancer` and change it to `type: NodePort`.

    * Save the file `Esc :wq`.

    > Note: Ingress forwards traffic to a Service (not directly to
    Pods). That's why we still need a Service wrapping our frontend
    Pod. However, it is not necessary for this Service to be of a
    LoadBalancer type, because now we will be accessing the frontend
    through Ingress and not through a dedicated frontend
    LoadBalancer. The Service has to be of a NodePort type instead.

1. Check the Service type.

    ```shell
    kubectl get svc
    ```

    ```
    NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    backend      ClusterIP   10.111.2.72    <none>        8080/TCP       5h
    db           ClusterIP   10.111.13.61   <none>        3306/TCP       1d
    frontend     NodePort    10.111.10.20   <none>        80:31661/TCP   36m
    kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.111.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        1d
    ```

1. Create the file `ingress.yaml`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: gceme-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - http:
          paths:
          - path: /gceme/*
            backend:
              serviceName: frontend
              servicePort: 80
    ```

    This will expose the Service `frontend` using the relative path `/gceme`.

1. Create the Ingress. Open two terminal windows.

    in the first terminal

    ```shell
    kubectl get ingress --watch
    ```

    In the second terminal

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml  # in the second terminal
    ```

    Wait until you see IP in the address field. The application will be available as `http://<ingress-ip>/gceme/`.
    It can take another 5-10 minutes before the LoadBalancer is configured and starts directing traffic.

    You should see output similar to this in the first terminal:

    ```
    NAME            HOSTS   ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
    gceme-ingress   *                        80      0s
    gceme-ingress   *       35.227.223.114   80      6m22s
    ```

    Try browsing to various URLs:
    1. `http://<ingress-ip>/gceme/`
    1. `http://<ingress-ip>/gceme/sub`
    1. `http://<ingress-ip>/gceme` (no trailing '/')
    1. `http://<ingress-ip>/site`

  Note only the first two, above, route traffic to the `frontend` service, as
  specified in the ingress.yaml file for the **path**.

  In the Cloud Console go to **Networking: Network services -> Load balancing** and examine the created load balancer.

## Use Static IP

By default, Ingress uses an ephemeral IP which may change during the time. To create a DNS record and issue SSL certificates one needs a static IP. In this exercise, you will create one and use it with Ingress.

1. Create a static IP.

    ```shell
    gcloud compute addresses create web-static-ip --global
    ```

    > Note: You can retrieve the static IP using the gcloud CLI

    ```shell
    gcloud compute addresses list
    ```

1. Assign it to the Ingress by adding the `global-static-ip-name` annotation.

    ```shell
    kubectl edit ingress/gceme-ingress
    ```

    ```yaml
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "web-static-ip"
    ```

    When you save the file, Kubernetes will change the IP of the load
    balancer according to the annotation. You may get the new IP address
    from the Cloud Console or Ingress resource.

    It can then take 5-10 minutes before the LoadBalancer is configured and
    starts directing traffic at the new static IP address.

## Optional Exercises

### Specify app domain

1. The `gceme` app should be accessible using a specific DNS name.
1. Modify your local `/etc/hosts` and set `gceme-training.com` domain to be resolved to the ingress IP address.
1. Modify the Ingress definition appropriately. Find the section `Name-based virtual hosting` in [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#name-based-virtual-hosting) document for reference.
1. Access `gceme-training.com` from your web browser.
1. Verify that you can't access `gceme` app using IP address anymore.

    1. The `spec` rules section should contain the following:

        ```yaml
        rules:
        - host: gceme-training.com
          http:
            paths:
            - backend:
                serviceName: frontend
                servicePort: 80
              path: /gceme/*
        ```

        > Note: `/etc/hosts` should be modified on your local machine, not the Cloud Console.

    </p>
    </details>

### Use TLS

1. Create a self-signed certificate for `gceme` app for the `gceme-training.com` domain [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-with-openssl).
1. Create a Kubernetes Secret for `gceme` app. The Secret should contain the certificate and private key.
1. Add a `tls` section to the ingress definition. You can use the `tls` section from [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#types-of-ingress) document for reference.
1. Redeploy, open app in a web browser and examine certificate details. Use [this](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/how-to-view-ssl-certificate-details-on-chrome-56) link to see how a certificate can be viewed in chrome.

<p>

1. Create a self-signed certificate.

    ```shell
    openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout gceme_key.pem -out gceme_cert.pem -days 365 -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Sunnyvale/O=Altoros/OU=Training/CN=gceme-training.com"
    ```

1. Import the secret to Kubernetes.

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret tls gceme-tls --cert=gceme_cert.pem --key=gceme_key.pem
    ```

1. Add the tls certificates section to the Ingress `spec`.

    ```yaml
    tls:
    - hosts:
      - gceme-training.com
      secretName: gceme-tls
    ```

1. The final `ingress.yaml` should look like the following:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: web-static-ip
      name: gceme-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: gceme-training.com
        http:
          paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: frontend
              servicePort: 80
            path: /gceme/*
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - gceme-training.com
        secretName: gceme-tls
    ```

* You can troubleshoot certificate issues by viewing the Ingress events.

    ```shell
    kubectl describe ing gceme-ingress
    ```
